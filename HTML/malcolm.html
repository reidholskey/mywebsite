    <p> G Malcolm Pridgeon was a previous starting offensive lineman for the Ohio State Buckeyes, but was not drafted onto a team after his collegiant carreer. He is an aggressive lineman and was a big part of the Buckeyes, and will now be assisting
      the Cleveland Browns as part of the practice squad and will eventaully earn a place on the starting lineup as a player in the games. His diverse skill set and quick feet will allow him to move quick against faster defensive lineman and his
      bulky frame will allow him to over power his competition.
