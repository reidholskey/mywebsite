    <p> With all of the pressure that was put on these players this year to save the Browns franchise and turn it around for the better, sometimes more emotion than is needed comes out and seems hostile towards eachother, but as a team the Browns
      want to ensure everyone that they are sticking together and are in this to win it together and nothing can tear apart the bond that they have built in camps and in the games that they have played so far.
