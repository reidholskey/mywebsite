    <p> Odell in his recent interview with the Browns media talks about how even with the Browns slow start at 2-3 that, "We are still trying to find out who we are offensively." With Jarvis Laundry and Odell Beckham on the team you would think that
      this team could be firing on all cylanders offensively, but that is not the case in this situation. Odell speaks highly of his teammates but also adds, "We are going to go to work in practice and fix what we can fix" which Browns fans seem
      content with this knowledge of knowing that their team is going to continue to try and get better with each and every week and get ready for each team they play each week.
